"""Reading the companyfacts archive into one fact per row.

The archive holds one JSON member per filer, nested
taxonomy -> tag -> unit -> [facts]. Two filters run here, before any DataFrame
is built:

  - only tags the schema can reference, ~150 against a median of ~270 us-gaap
    tags per company;
  - only 10-K and 10-Q facts, which doubles as the entity filter - funds,
    trusts and shells file N-CSR and 10-D, never a 10-K, so they drop out
    without needing the 1.4 GB submissions archive.

Members are read out of the zip in place: one company is a seek and a single
deflate stream, rather than 17 GB of disk to unpack the whole thing.
