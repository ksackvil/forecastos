"""Extract trades from an IEX TOPS capture.

A capture is a gzipped pcap of one trading day - quotes, system messages and
trades interleaved, over 10 GB when busy - of which trades are a small part.

Parsing message by message spends almost all its time decoding messages it then
discards (~15 min on ~14 GB). This module instead treats the decompressed stream
as bytes: every trade report opens with the same three-byte signature, so it
scans for that literal, copies the matching records, and reinterprets them as a
numpy record array in one pass (~60 sec on ~10 GB).

The tradeoff: packet headers are skipped, so IEX-TP `seq` is unavailable.
`trade_id` is monotonic and orders trades just as well.

    """Every trade in the capture at `path`, one row each.

    Looks up the trade signature for `tops_version`, carves every record that
    matches it, then reinterprets those bytes as trades.

    Args:
        path: gzipped pcap capture covering a single session.
        tops_version: version the capture was published under, spelled as the
            catalog spells it - '1.6' or '1.5'. Selects the trade signature.
        date: session the capture covers, 'YYYYMMDD'. Only bounds the timestamp
            plausibility check that rejects false positives.
        progress_every: print progress every N chunks; 0 to stay silent.

    Returns:
        One row per trade: symbol, ts (tz-aware UTC), size, price, trade_id, a
        bool per PRICE_ELIGIBLE_SALE_CONDITION_FLAGS entry, and price_eligible.
